# JobCandidates

JobCandidates API will help Recruiter to find qualified candidates.

There is a unit test named VerifyQualifiedCandidates.cs in FindCandidateServiceTestRunner. Here I have tried to cover my logic to find
best possible qualified Candidates

In launchSettings I have defined API will run at http://localhost:5200
Also allowed CORS for http://localhost:4200 for Angular project
